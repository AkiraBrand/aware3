Hi aware3 team!

Thank you for requesting a code sample. In this sample, I've written a very simple class "Church", with behaviors that manipulate its instantiated attributes. I wrote it using TDD with the Chai testing framework. I am a big fan of TDD, and I find it useful for writing clean, DRY code quickly. You can run <npm test> to run the testing suite.
